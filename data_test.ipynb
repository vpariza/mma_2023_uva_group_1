       " 'description': 'This charming and well-maintained single-family home is located close to the city center of Amersfoort. The house has a deep, secluded backyard with a large shed with roof (2020) and the existing extension at the rear of the house has created a lot of extra living space on the ground floor. The spacious kitchen, modern bathroom and the two spacious (possibility for three) bedrooms make this a wonderful family home! The Hogeweg has been transformed in recent years, together with the new Hogekwartier district, into a beautiful entrance to the city. The cozy historic center is within walking distance, the NS central station is within cycling distance and from the house you have a good connection with the A28 motorway and the adjacent A1. Shopping centers with supermarkets on Euterpe and Neptunusplein are close by and the Amarena swimming pool is within walking distance I N D E L I N G Ground floor: entrance/hall with characteristic wooden panelling, toilet and meter cupboard. The spacious attractive living room has a wooden floor and a wood stove (for acquisition), the stove installed in 2019 ensures a wonderfully warm house in the cold seasons and keeps heating costs low. From the living area, the kitchen with comfortable underfloor heating is accessible through French doors. Due to the use of two skylights, large windows in the rear facade and the patio doors to the garden, there is a lot of natural light. The modern corner kitchen is equipped with various built-in appliances such as a wide oven with 5-burner gas stove, plate warmer, microwave, sink and a recently renovated dishwasher. You will also find the connection for the washing machine here. First floor: landing with second toilet and cupboard with central heating boiler. On this floor you will find two spacious bedrooms, if a third (bed) room is desired, it is easy to place a wall in the large bedroom at the rear. The bathroom in black and white color scheme has underfloor heating, a shower cabin, a double sink and a bathtub. Attic: the attic can be reached from the landing via a Vlizotrap. This spacious attic spans the entire width of the house. Garden and storage room: the backyard with a north location is no less than 18 meters deep and is beautifully landscaped. The garden is partly paved and there is a lawn with a path to the recently built wooden shed with a roof. The barn of approximately 15 m² offers a lot of space and possibilities, for example you can create a nice home workplace, hobby / DIY room or extra living space. The shed also offers space for storing garden equipment or bicycles. You can enjoy the garden in all seasons under the spacious roof. On a hot summer day, you can choose whether you want to cool off under the roof or worship the sun in the middle of the garden. K E N M E R K E N - year of construction 1905 - living area 110 m² - plot area 189 m² - energy label C - generous living space on the ground floor - possibilities for extra living space in the barn - underfloor heating in kitchen and bathroom - low heating costs thanks to wood stove - spacious garden with new barn + roof (installed in 2020) - exterior painting work carried out in 2019 - within walking distance of the historic center - near arterial roads'}"
